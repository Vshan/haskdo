{-- Here's how the functionality works:

  - The user logs his entire day in Google Keep on his phone.
  - The user also has a goal file where he records his goals for the day.

  - The log and goal file are exported to Dropbox, where it syncs with
  - user's other Dropbox folders.

  - On user's computer, a bash script, which runs periodically, syncs
  - the files from Dropbox to a local directory, which contains the
  - Haskell script.

  - The bash script starts on boot-up or wake-up and then runs every
  - 5 min until a control flag is set to true. Effectively saying that
  - sync has been succesful.

  - When control flag is true, the bash script runs the Haskell script
  - with the day's files and Haskell generates a master file $DAY.txt

  - Possibly through another Haskell script, generate an API which allows
  - two date arguments to be passed and generates some stats.

--}

{-- What's the end goal?

  - Create a program api which takes two (already logged) days
  - and calculates the cumulative time spent on each task along
  - with percentage of time spent.

  - Every day the program should generate a final $DAY.txt file
  - which has the logged activities, time spent + percentage and
  - the goal_of_today part.
